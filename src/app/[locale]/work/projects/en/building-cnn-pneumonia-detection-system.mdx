## Overview

In this project, I built an AI-based pneumonia detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. The system analyzes chest X-ray images to identify signs of pneumonia, helping medical professionals to diagnose the disease faster and more accurately. This solution leverages deep learning techniques and medical imaging data to improve healthcare outcomes.

## Key Features

- **CNN Architecture**: Designed and trained a deep CNN model optimized for image classification tasks on chest X-ray datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented robust image preprocessing pipelines including normalization, augmentation, and resizing to improve model generalization.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Used TensorFlow and Keras to train the model, monitored performance through accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC metrics.
- **User Interface**: Developed a simple web interface to upload X-ray images and receive instant predictions with confidence scores.
- **Explainability**: Integrated Grad-CAM visualization to highlight areas of X-rays that influence the modelâ€™s decision, aiding interpretability for clinicians.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For building, training, and deploying the CNN model.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **OpenCV / PIL**: For image processing and augmentation.
- **Flask / FastAPI**: (Optional) For serving the model via REST API.
- **React / Next.js**: (Optional) For building the front-end interface for user interaction.

## Challenges and Learnings

Handling the limited and imbalanced medical dataset was a significant challenge, which was mitigated by applying data augmentation and transfer learning techniques. Optimizing the model to reduce false negatives was critical due to the medical implications. Additionally, providing explainable AI outputs helped bridge the gap between AI predictions and clinical trust.

## Outcome

The system achieved high accuracy and reliable detection performance on test datasets, demonstrating its potential to support clinical diagnosis. It provides a fast, automated tool to assist radiologists and healthcare workers in identifying pneumonia cases from X-ray images, contributing to improved patient care.
