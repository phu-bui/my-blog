## Overview

In this project, I developed a scalable and efficient monitoring system using Next.js for the front-end and backend API routes. The system provides real-time data visualization, alert management, and detailed reporting to help maintain critical infrastructure health. By leveraging Next.jsâ€™s server-side rendering and API capabilities, the monitoring platform delivers fast and reliable performance.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Built an interactive dashboard that displays live metrics, system status, and alerts with smooth user experience and minimal latency.
- **Alert Management**: Implemented a comprehensive alerting mechanism that supports multiple alert types, notifications, and recovery tracking.
- **API Integration**: Used Next.js API routes to connect with backend services and databases for fetching monitoring data and updating alert statuses.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the system is accessible and fully responsive across devices, enabling users to monitor systems on the go.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed the system to easily integrate new data sources and alert types, supporting future scalability and customization.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building both the frontend UI and backend API routes with server-side rendering.
- **React**: For creating reusable UI components and managing state efficiently.
- **Tailwind CSS / Styled-Components**: (Choose one based on your project) For styling components with responsiveness and maintainability.
- **WebSocket / Server-Sent Events (optional)**: For real-time data updates on the dashboard.
- **PostgreSQL / MongoDB / Other DB**: For storing monitoring data and alert logs.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was optimizing the real-time data flow to ensure minimal latency and high reliability even under heavy load. Leveraging Next.js API routes alongside efficient data caching strategies helped maintain responsiveness. Additionally, designing a flexible alerting system that supports different alert criteria and recovery states was crucial for usability.

## Outcome

The monitoring system has been successfully deployed and is actively used to track infrastructure health across multiple sites. It has reduced incident response times and improved operational visibility. The project showcases the power of Next.js as a full-stack framework suitable for building modern, scalable monitoring solutions.
